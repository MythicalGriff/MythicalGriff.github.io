    <p class="w3-large w3-center">A Virtual Reality Headset (VR) is a newer technology consisting of the user wearing a helmet-like console on their head, it generally weighs anywhere from 380 to 600 grams and is easy to put on. VR immerses the user in a world that is either completely unlike or completely similar to ours, it is a new experience that can help with many issues and push further generations more into the future. A VR consists of a screen in the headset structure that allows the user to see around them in a completely different environment and interact with it in a visual sense, with the technology we have as of currently we can already stimulate our sense of touch as well.</p>
